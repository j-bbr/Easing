# Easing and Tweening Library for Unity

Tween any float, vector2, vector3 or quaternion. Extension methods for often used properties so that tweening can be as easy as 
```csharp
easeTarget.ScaleTo(target, length, easing)
```
with target being the target scale (vector3), length the time (float) the animation should take and 
easing the chosen easing function (enum).
